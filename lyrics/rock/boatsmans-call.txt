[Verse 1]
The boatman calls from the lake
A lone loon dives upon the water
I put my hand over her
Down in the lime tree arbour
The wind in the trees is whispering
Whispering low that I love her
She puts her hand over mine
Down in the lime tree arbour

[Chorus]
Through every breath that I breathe
And every place I go
There is a hand that protects me
And I do love her so
